## 🧠 What I Did
- Imported sales data in Power BI.
- Used the Python scripting feature to create a custom **line chart** that visualizes **Sales Over Time by Region**.
- Combined `Year`, `Month`, and `Day` into a single `Date` column using `pandas.to_datetime()`.
- Plotted sales trends per region using `matplotlib`, with customization such as markers, lines, gridlines, legends, and rotation of x-ticks.
