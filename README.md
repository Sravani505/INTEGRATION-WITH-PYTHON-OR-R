# Power BI Task 4 – Python Integration

This repository contains the deliverables for **Task 4: Integration with Python or R** as part of the internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED**.

## 🔍 Task Objective
Use Python or R scripts within Power BI to perform advanced data analysis or visualizations.

## 👤 Internship Details

- **Company Name:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED  
- **Intern Name:** Sravani  
- **Intern ID:** CT06DN1171  
- **Domain:** Power BI  
- **Batch Duration:** 6 Weeks (May 20th – July 5th, 2025)  
- **Mentor:** Neela Santhosh Kumar


## 🧠 What I Did
- Imported sales data in Power BI.
- Used the Python scripting feature to create a custom **line chart** that visualizes **Sales Over Time by Region**.
- Combined `Year`, `Month`, and `Day` into a single `Date` column using `pandas.to_datetime()`.
- Plotted sales trends per region using `matplotlib`, with customization such as markers, lines, gridlines, legends, and rotation of x-ticks.

  ## 🖼️ Visual Highlight

> 📌 _Sales Over Time by Region using Python in Power BI_

This Python visual shows how sales changed daily across regions (North, South, East, West) using Python’s plotting features — enabling more flexible and detailed data storytelling.


## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**
